CS319 Project

Description:
	Sea Adventures is a horizontal scrolling shooter game based on the game called space shooter. The goal of the project is to implement the game using OOP structure. The game will be implemented using Javafx.

The Specifics of Sea Adventures:
Game’s objective is to pass several levels and in the last one to fight the final boss. In addition, in each level on the path of the hero there will be various enemies who will try to stop him.
It’s a multiplayer game. Therefore, two players can play it together.

The map is basically bottom of the ocean, while there are islands which need to be avoided. In addition, the game will be horizontal, unlike Space Shooters. 

Controllers are WASD for Player 1 and UP-DOWN-LEFT-RIGHT for Player 2. In addition, Player 1 shoots with spacebar while player 2 shoots with “.” button.

The gameplay: The main hero which is a submarine has health and energy. If health goes to zero, submarine is destroyed and the game ends. In addition, there will be different enemies with different skills and atacks. At the same time, submarine will also have different skills which have a cooldown and require some energy. The energy can be filled collecting the shiny objects on the map.

There will be three levels. Each level has small bosses while the third level will have the final boss. The submarine will gain experience while killing the enemies in order to level up and get better weapons.
